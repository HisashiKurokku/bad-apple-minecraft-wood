## Important

Please run the codes in the following order:
- convert.py
- overlay.py
- stacking.py

After doing the step above correctly, you should have a new .png file called "oak_planks", replace it with the original oak plank texture in your resource pack.

To make an animated texture, create a new text file and rename it with this format "name_of_the_texture.png.mcmeta", in this case, "oak_planks.png.mcmeta". After that, paste this in and save the file:

```
{
  "animation": {}
}
```

You're good to go!

P/S: If you're lazy to do the steps above, you can download the pack [here](https://github.com/HisashiKurokku/bad-apple-minecraft-wood/releases/tag/resource_pack).
